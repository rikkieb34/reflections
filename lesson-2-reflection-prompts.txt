What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a new repository in the directory that you are in. This is done in
order to have a repository to track the changes that have been made to the 
directory/project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows what files are going to be committed to your repo.
The working directory is the current directory that you are working on, which
can be different than the staging area. The working directory will contain
all the changes that have been made to the project/application. The repository
holds all the changes that have been pushed to it. The staging area is a good
way to keep track of which files are going to be committed before committing
them, this will allow you to remove or add certain files to be committed.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
